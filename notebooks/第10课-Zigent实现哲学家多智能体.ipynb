The answer, in a Confucian sense, would be that neither came first; they are interdependent. The chicken and the egg are part of a continuous cycle of life, where each is necessary for the other's existence. This reflects the Confucian principle of the interconnectedness of all things, where the past and the future are not separate but are part of a continuous whole.\"}      \n",
